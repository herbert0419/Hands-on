        "Pandas and NumPy are great libraries, but when it comes to large datasets, they are inefficient because they take longer to compute than smaller datasets. This is where Dask comes in. The first step to understanding Dask is to know one of the key features that sets Dask apart from the competition is that it is entirely written and implemented in Python. ***The collection APIs of Dask is designed to scale NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn natively. It uses parallel and distributed computing to overcome the limits of a single machine.***"
